# TerraCD üåç

**TerraCD** is an Open Source application designed to manage infrastructure as code (IaC) using **Terraform** or **OpenTofu**, following GitOps principles. It provides a declarative approach to synchronizing changes made in a Git repository with the target environment, automating and simplifying infrastructure management.

---

## üöÄ **Key Features**

1. **Declarative Deployments**
   - Automatically detects changes in Git repositories and applies configurations to target environments.

2. **Manual Approvals**
   - Requires manual approval for critical changes before applying plans.

3. **Real-Time Logs**
   - View real-time logs for `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands.

4. **Centralized Project Management**
   - Manage multiple projects from a single intuitive interface.

5. **Multi-Backend Compatibility**
   - Supports remote state backends such as S3, GCS, Terraform Cloud, and more.

6. **Integrated Notifications**
   - Sends alerts to Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, or via email.

7. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Fine-grained permission control for users and teams.

8. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin system to integrate new tools like Pulumi or Ansible.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

TerraCD is composed of modular components:

1. **User Interface (UI)**
   - Built with React and TailwindCSS.
   - Provides an intuitive dashboard to monitor deployments, logs, and states.

2. **Backend/API**
   - Written in Rust with Actix-Web.
   - Exposes a REST API for managing projects, executing jobs, and handling states.

3. **Worker Executor**
   - Executes Terraform commands in isolated containers.
   - Manages interaction with Terraform's remote state backend.

4. **Webhook Listener**
   - Processes Git events (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to detect repository changes.

5. **State Manager**
   - Synchronizes and manages Terraform states, avoiding concurrent conflicts.

6. **Notification System**
   - Integrates messaging services to notify about changes and status updates.

## üåü **SEO Optimized Description**

**TerraCD** - Open Source GitOps platform for managing infrastructure as code with Terraform and OpenTofu. Automate deployments, synchronize Git changes, and monitor infrastructure in real time. Extendable, secure, and built for modern multi-cloud environments.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Prerequisites**

1. **Software**:
   - Docker
   - Kubernetes (optional for cluster deployment)
   - Terraform or OpenTofu
   - Node.js (for frontend)
   - Rust (for backend)

2. **Configurations**:
   - Access to a remote backend for Terraform (e.g., S3, GCS, Terraform Cloud).
   - Git repository with infrastructure configurations.

---

## ‚ö° **Getting Started**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TerraCD.git
cd TerraCD
```

### **2. Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file at the root of the project using the provided `.env.example` file as a template.

### **3. Run the Backend**
```bash
cd backend
cargo build --release
cargo run
```

### **4. Run the Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **5. Deploy on Kubernetes**
```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/
```

## üéØ **Usage**

1. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Configure a new project by providing:
   - Git repository URL.
   - Remote state backend details.
   - Variables required for Terraform.
3. Make changes in the repository and watch TerraCD automatically detect, plan, and apply them.
